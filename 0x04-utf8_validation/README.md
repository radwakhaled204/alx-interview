About
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) is a character encoding that is widely used to represent text in computing systems. It is part of the Unicode standard and allows the representation of almost all the characters from various writing systems in the world.

Some of the Key features of UTF-8 that make is so popular include

Variable-Length encoding making it backward compatible with ASCII
Multilingual Support making it suitable for i18n
Self-Synchronization reducing the risk of data lost during transmission and storage.
In this project we will write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
